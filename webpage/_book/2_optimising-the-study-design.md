	<h4><strong>1.1.1 What to measure and report and why?</strong></h4><p>A basic site description for an experimental or observational site includes the location where the study was performed and under what biotic and abiotic conditions. The documentation of the basic characteristics of the system and correct reporting of the basic data facilitates and improves comparisons with other studies and downstream usage of the data in meta-analyses and other data syntheses (Hillebrand &amp; Gurevitch, 2013; Haddaway &amp; Verhoeven, 2015; Gerstner et al., 2017). For any study it is thus important to report and measure the following information for each site: i) geographical location and basic site description, ii) abiotic and biotic properties of the ecosystem, iii) basic climate and weather data, and iv) experimental set-up, analysis, and results. More specific for climate-change experiments <em>sensu stricto</em>, variables that may be influenced by the manipulation need to be measured in all treatments. These include variables such as soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient availability, along with various biotic responses described in detail in other protocols (<a href="http://climexhandbook.w.uib.no/handbook/s2-carbon-and-nutrient-cycling/">see Supporting Information S2 Carbon and nutrient cycling</a>, <a href="http://climexhandbook.w.uib.no/handbook/s3-water-cycling/">S3 Water cycling</a>, <a href="http://climexhandbook.w.uib.no/handbook/s4-species-and-interactions/">S4 Species and interactions</a> and <a href="http://climexhandbook.w.uib.no/handbook/s5-stress-physiology/">S5 Stress physiology</a>). For <em>in situ</em> experiments (e.g. space and time), it is important to measure variables that may be influenced by the spatial or temporal component of the experiment.</p><p>The <strong>geographical location and basic site description</strong> should describe the study location i.e. coordinates, vegetation type, and climate (Hillebrand &amp; Gurevitch, 2013; Morueta-Holme et al., 2018). This effort enables and facilitates further upscaling and modelling of the experiments beyond the observational boundary as well as increasing the potential for the dataset to be used in meta-analysis.</p><p>The pre-treatment measurements of the <strong>abiotic and biotic properties</strong> of the ecosystem report the conditions of the soil–plant–atmosphere system before the experimental manipulation (i.e. baseline ecosystem measurements) and enables between-experimental site comparisons in a global context. It is crucial to measure these key variables before the manipulations start in order to evaluate changes imposed by ambient, non-manipulated environmental conditions. Similarly, for natural experiments and long-term monitoring, baseline data (e.g. pre- and/or post-observational measurements) are important. The key variables that should be reported are of a physical, chemical, and biological nature, and also concern ecosystem services (e.g. water quality, carbon and nutrient cycling, biodiversity; Costanza et al., 1997). They are also important for process modelling and data usage in a meta-analysis. In addition to the before-after treatment measurements, it is advisable to have plots in the experimental design that test control vs. impact (Christie et al. 2019).</p><p>When conducting a climate-change study, it is crucial to measure <strong>environmental conditions </strong>during the study and if applicable in every treatment as these potential drivers of ecosystem functioning may deviate substantially from ambient conditions, and treatments may have effects on other drivers, such as warming leading to changes in the water balance (Damgaard et al., 2018). The most important climate variables include air temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation (which may be in the form of irrigation or precipitation removal), as well as soil temperature and moisture.</p><p>Finally, for the further use of the data from a climate-change studies, i.e. for a meta-analysis, it is crucial to correctly follow open science practise and report the study design, analysis, and results (Hillebrand &amp; Gurevitch, 2013; Haddaway &amp; Verhoeven, 2015; Gerstner et al., 2017).</p><p> </p><h4><strong>1.1.2 Setting up a sustainable climate-change study</strong></h4><p>Once a decision on the important matters in the research are made, such as the research question, the experimental treatments and study design, the study system, site selection, and other important issues related to the research (which is not the purpose of this protocol and will not be discussed here), a number of more practical issues have to be decided. Climate-change studies are expensive and resource demanding and the goal should be to make the most out of them. One of the most important decisions is that of sustainability: how long will the study last, how many people and how much activity will be involved, and is there any chance that there will be new projects and measurements coming in? As a general rule of thumb, there is little to lose by erring on the side of optimism (as in expecting a lot of activity), although financial and spatial constraints may, of course, limit the options. Some general advice to guide decision-making is offered in Table 1.1 and Figure 1.1.</p><p> </p><h4><strong>1.1.3 At which spatial scale should you measure?</strong></h4><p>The scale at which a variable should be measured has to be considered carefully. Measurements can be quick and simple or labour-intensive and expensive. Most importantly, the scale of the measurements should depend on the research question and the study system, but here are some general rules that are widely applicable, unless there are strong reasons to do differently related to the research questions or study design:</p><ul><li>Generally, all variables that are stable across the site and that are not affected by the experiment within the timeframe of the study should be measured at the site scale.</li><li>Conversely, variables that are influenced by the experimental treatments should be measured at the plot scale.</li><li>Variables that vary across the site should preferably be measured at the block or plot scale.</li></ul><p>In practice, many of these decisions will be affected by economic and data analysis considerations, and there is likely to be a choice between expensive installations/optimal measurements with low replication (i.e. in some but not all treated plots) v. using cheaper/simpler measurements and technology which may allow measuring it across all replicates in the experiments. However, cheap technology and smaller and better loggers are developing rapidly, offering new opportunities. In heterogeneous habitats (horizontal and vertical), it is advisable to measure variables in several places.</p><p> </p><h4><strong>1.1.4 What is the ideal sampling interval?</strong></h4><p>Similar considerations should be made for the sampling intervals. The frequency of the sampling will mainly depend on the temporal resolution of interest (annual variation, seasonal patterns, daily fluctuations) and also on whether manual sampling or automated loggers are used. If the data are used for modelling, it is important to consider the required temporal resolution of the model, which is often on a fine scale. For example, modelling of ecosystem gas exchange will require half-hourly to hourly climate data input. The calculation of some long-term variables such as seasonal temperature sums or daily maxima also requires relatively high-resolution data. Also here, rapid improvements in technology open up opportunities.</p><p> </p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Table 1.1</strong> Checklist of questions to ask and guidance when setting up a sustainable and multi-purpose climate-change study from site to sub-plot level.</span></p><table style="width: 100%" width="601"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 19.0037%;text-align: left;vertical-align: top"><strong>Scale</strong></td><td style="width: 38.7454%;text-align: left;vertical-align: top"><strong>Question</strong></td><td style="width: 42.1587%;text-align: left;vertical-align: top"><strong>Guidance</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 19.0037%;text-align: left;vertical-align: top" rowspan="5"><p><strong>Site (selection)</strong></p><p><strong>Figure 1.1A</strong></p></td><td style="width: 38.7454%;text-align: left;vertical-align: top"><p><em>What does the system represent? </em></p><p><em>Which environment, habitat, ecosystem, former and present land use? </em></p><p><em>Are there any specific factors like off-site effects (run-off, shade, nutrient inputs etc.) to consider?</em></p></td><td style="width: 42.1587%;text-align: left;vertical-align: top"><p>Sites should be placed within the limits of the relevant system, avoiding off-site effects when possible.
