<p>Systematic reporting of basic site information of the studied system is necessary to ensure that studies are repeatable and to enable data re-use across studies, syntheses, modelling, and upscaling (Haddaway &amp; Verhoeven, 2015; Gerstner et al., 2017). In climate change research, there are experiments <em>sensu stricto</em> and natural experiments in space (i.e. gradient studies) and time (i.e. observational studies). This chapter on reporting and documentation is applicable to all these types of studies (if not otherwise specified). In addition, many of the principles discussed in this chapter are not exclusively relevant for climate-change studies, but also apply to global-change studies in general.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the necessary basic site information of studies, is often incomplete or missing in scientific publications (Hillebrand &amp; Gurevitch, 2013). In this chapter we therefore describe which key site, study system, and study design variables and information should be collected, and how this information is best reported.</p>
<p>We first discuss how to design and set up an experiment or observational study that may serve multiple uses beyond the needs of the particular project. Then we describe basic geographical location and basic site description (e.g. coordinates, elevation, land-use history, vegetation), physical (e.g. soil horizon, pH), chemical (e.g. nutrient availability), and meteorological variables, and finally how to report your data. Although some of this information may not directly relate to the particular research question or hypotheses, reporting all relevant site information is essential as it puts the study in a larger context and is the key to making data and results useful beyond the particular research for which they were designed.</p>

<p>A basic site description for an experimental or observational site includes the location where the study was performed and under what biotic and abiotic conditions. The documentation of the basic characteristics of the system and correct reporting of the basic data facilitates and improves comparisons with other studies and downstream usage of the data in meta-analyses and other data syntheses (Hillebrand &amp; Gurevitch, 2013; Haddaway &amp; Verhoeven, 2015; Gerstner et al., 2017). For any study it is thus important to report and measure the following information for each site: i) geographical location and basic site description, ii) abiotic and biotic properties of the ecosystem, iii) basic climate and weather data, and iv) experimental set-up, analysis, and results. More specific for climate-change experiments <em>sensu stricto</em>, variables that may be influenced by the manipulation need to be measured in all treatments. These include variables such as soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient availability, along with various biotic responses described in detail in other protocols (<a href="http://climexhandbook.w.uib.no/handbook/s2-carbon-and-nutrient-cycling/">see Supporting Information S2 Carbon and nutrient cycling</a>, <a href="http://climexhandbook.w.uib.no/handbook/s3-water-cycling/">S3 Water cycling</a>, <a href="http://climexhandbook.w.uib.no/handbook/s4-species-and-interactions/">S4 Species and interactions</a> and <a href="http://climexhandbook.w.uib.no/handbook/s5-stress-physiology/">S5 Stress physiology</a>). For <em>in situ</em> experiments (e.g. space and time), it is important to measure variables that may be influenced by the spatial or temporal component of the experiment.</p>
<p>The <strong>geographical location and basic site description</strong> should describe the study location i.e. coordinates, vegetation type, and climate (Hillebrand &amp; Gurevitch, 2013; Morueta-Holme et al., 2018). This effort enables and facilitates further upscaling and modelling of the experiments beyond the observational boundary as well as increasing the potential for the dataset to be used in meta-analysis.</p>
<p>The pre-treatment measurements of the <strong>abiotic and biotic properties</strong> of the ecosystem report the conditions of the soil–plant–atmosphere system before the experimental manipulation (i.e. baseline ecosystem measurements) and enables between-experimental site comparisons in a global context. It is crucial to measure these key variables before the manipulations start in order to evaluate changes imposed by ambient, non-manipulated environmental conditions. Similarly, for natural experiments and long-term monitoring, baseline data (e.g. pre- and/or post-observational measurements) are important. The key variables that should be reported are of a physical, chemical, and biological nature, and also concern ecosystem services (e.g. water quality, carbon and nutrient cycling, biodiversity; Costanza et al., 1997). They are also important for process modelling and data usage in a meta-analysis. In addition to the before-after treatment measurements, it is advisable to have plots in the experimental design that test control vs. impact (Christie et al. 2019).</p>
<p>When conducting a climate-change study, it is crucial to measure <strong>environmental conditions</strong> during the study and if applicable in every treatment as these potential drivers of ecosystem functioning may deviate substantially from ambient conditions, and treatments may have effects on other drivers, such as warming leading to changes in the water balance (Damgaard et al., 2018). The most important climate variables include air temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation (which may be in the form of irrigation or precipitation removal), as well as soil temperature and moisture.</p>
<p>Finally, for the further use of the data from a climate-change studies, i.e. for a meta-analysis, it is crucial to correctly follow open science practise and report the study design, analysis, and results (Hillebrand &amp; Gurevitch, 2013; Haddaway &amp; Verhoeven, 2015; Gerstner et al., 2017).</p>

<p>Once a decision on the important matters in the research are made, such as the research question, the experimental treatments and study design, the study system, site selection, and other important issues related to the research (which is not the purpose of this protocol and will not be discussed here), a number of more practical issues have to be decided. Climate-change studies are expensive and resource demanding and the goal should be to make the most out of them. One of the most important decisions is that of sustainability: how long will the study last, how many people and how much activity will be involved, and is there any chance that there will be new projects and measurements coming in? As a general rule of thumb, there is little to lose by erring on the side of optimism (as in expecting a lot of activity), although financial and spatial constraints may, of course, limit the options. Some general advice to guide decision-making is offered in Table 1.1 and Figure 1.1.</p>
</div>
<div id="at-which-spatial-scale-should-you-measure" class="section level3" number="1.1.3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> At which spatial scale should you measure?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#at-which-spatial-scale-should-you-measure"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The scale at which a variable should be measured has to be considered carefully. Measurements can be quick and simple or labour-intensive and expensive. Most importantly, the scale of the measurements should depend on the research question and the study system, but here are some general rules that are widely applicable, unless there are strong reasons to do differently related to the research questions or study design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally, all variables that are stable across the site and that are not affected by the experiment within the timeframe of the study should be measured at the site scale.</li>
<li>Conversely, variables that are influenced by the experimental treatments should be measured at the plot scale.</li>
<li>Variables that vary across the site should preferably be measured at the block or plot scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, many of these decisions will be affected by economic and data analysis considerations, and there is likely to be a choice between expensive installations/optimal measurements with low replication (i.e. in some but not all treated plots) v. using cheaper/simpler measurements and technology which may allow measuring it across all replicates in the experiments. However, cheap technology and smaller and better loggers are developing rapidly, offering new opportunities. In heterogeneous habitats (horizontal and vertical), it is advisable to measure variables in several places.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-the-ideal-sampling-interval" class="section level3" number="1.1.4">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.1.4</span> What is the ideal sampling interval?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-the-ideal-sampling-interval"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Similar considerations should be made for the sampling intervals. The frequency of the sampling will mainly depend on the temporal resolution of interest (annual variation, seasonal patterns, daily fluctuations) and also on whether manual sampling or automated loggers are used. If the data are used for modelling, it is important to consider the required temporal resolution of the model, which is often on a fine scale. For example, modelling of ecosystem gas exchange will require half-hourly to hourly climate data input. The calculation of some long-term variables such as seasonal temperature sums or daily maxima also requires relatively high-resolution data. Also here, rapid improvements in technology open up opportunities.</p>

A central pole supporting a ladder can be used in small plots to reach every point without touching the ground.

</h3>
<p>Ecosystem history, which includes historical soil and land management (i.e. disturbance, grazing, harvests or harvest regime, nutrient input and contamination, species introductions or extinctions) gives crucial information as any such changes may have a knock-on effect on a range of responses (Sala et al., 2000; Kepfer-Rojas et al., 2015). Providing accurate details of the ecosystem history (e.g. the number and degree of prescribed burning, fertilisation schemes, timber volume removed or the quantity of grazing animals) can be useful when assessing the impacts of land-use history and comparing different sites. These historical factors may also affect the responses of ecosystems to future environmental manipulations, such as climate, nutrient, and land use (Luo &amp; Chen, 2013; Domec et al., 2015; Kröel-Dulay et al., 2015; De Keersmaecker et al., 2016). Finally, ecosystem history can be of value if the ratio of C3 to C4 plants has changed, for example through crop rotations, as this allows for analyses of ecosystem processes that are based on stable isotopes without additional cost.</p>

<p>Latitude and longitude coordinates should be given (e.g. via GPS), in addition to the resolution of the position (e.g. ±3 m). Coordinates can help with finding additional information about a study site, such as weather data from a nearby station, or remote sensing products. It is also common to give the name of the location of the study site, the region, and country or continent. Multiple locations can be shown on a map.</p>

</h3>
<p>Atmospheric pressure, temperature, and radiation (including UV-B) change consistently with increasing elevation, while many other factors such as precipitation and wind vary regionally along elevational gradients (Körner, 2007). Slope is helpful in explaining observations related to soil hydraulic properties as well as the radiative conditions. Both slope and aspect influence surface temperature and are useful to report on a hill and in mountains, where topography changes over short distances. Elevation can be extracted from a GPS, and slope and aspect can easily be measured using a clinometer and compass, respectively. A number of free apps for these measurements are now available for smartphones. For slope, a long rigid plank can be placed on the ground and the clinometer sat flush on the plank in order to measure the slope. If the small-scale heterogeneity is high, a measuring post set to eye level &gt; 10m away from the plot provides a more accurate measurement of the average slope. Aspect is measured using a compass, facing downslope. Note that these parameters can be measured on different spatial scales; plot, block, or site. At coarser scales, these parameters can be determined from reference map sources.</p>

<p>Long-term climate data from each study site should be reported to enhance reproducibility (Morueta-Holme et al., 2018). Common variables are mean annual temperature and precipitation, seasonality, and length of the growing season. Mean annual temperature and precipitation may not be very informative whereas summer maximum, winter minimum temperature, and growing season length are more relevant. It is important to cite the source of the data, the time frame over which the data were collected, name of the location if the data were obtained by a weather station, and (if applicable) to explain any data processing (Morueta-Holme et al., 2018).</p>

<p>The habitat type (e.g. forest, grassland, desert), dominant plant functional type (e.g. trees, graminoids, forbs, mosses), cover and height of the dominant vegetation layers (e.g. trees, shrubs, dwarf-shrubs, herbaceous, cryptogams), and vegetation type (using relevant national or international classification schemes) of the study site should be described. It is also common to list the dominant species, and some biodiversity or structural information such as species richness and/or evenness.</p>
