However, repeated non-destructive estimates AGB preferred manipulation experiments (e.g. Kongstad et al., 2012; Tielbörger et al., 2014) cutting grazing part disturbance regime studied ecosystem. Non-destructive proxies AGB can normally measured little training, measurements time-consuming. Field spectroscopy requires elaborate (technical) skills, can hampered difficult external requirements unfavourable weather/cloud conditions tropical environments (Ferner et al., 2015).methods described divided 1) non-forest AGB methods 2) forest AGB methods. Shrublands may fall either two categories. non-forest ecosystems (low-vegetation agriculture, grasslands, shrublands, etc.), frequently used non-destructive AGB methods 1) point-intercept method (Goodall, 1952; Jonasson, 1988; Damgaard et al., 2009; Hudson & Henty et al., 2009; Valolahti et al., 2015), 2) field spectroscopy (Pearson et al., 1976; Milton et al., 2009; Ferner et al., 2015), 3) visual cover estimation (Braun-Blanquet, 1932; Sykes et al., 1983; Peet et al., 1998). methods require destructive harvest outside experimental area obtain AGB estimates non-destructive vegetation assessments. Comparisons methods show methods can effective estimating AGB (Onodi et al., 2017a).Measuring AGB agriculture, grasslands, shrublands (non-forests) (Gold standard)) Destructive harvesting (Bertora et al., 2012). AGB rooted within AGB observation plots harvested clipping vegetation homogeneously (e.g. 2 cm) soil surface except vegetation includes substantial amounts rosette-plants includes aboveground stolens.

Reference surveys outside experimental observation plots need repeated time change vegetation occurred, example pest outbreaks vegetation responses experimental treatments (Onodi et al., 2017b).survey plot, total number hits species pin expressed proportion pin-hits plot. proportions species pin-hits correlated determined dry plant biomass (Figure 2.4, INCREASE, 2014). derived relationship species used convert pin-hits measured AGB observation plots biomass per area. total AGB AGB observation plot equals sum biomass species; AGB needs expressed per m2. vegetation surveys carried time year consecutive years, measures AGB can used estimate ANPP (see section Special cases ).\nFigure 2.4: Correlation pin-hits harvested biomass areas outside AGB observation plots ((data Clocaenog field experiment, UK; Domínguez et al., 2015).

NDVI (Pearson et al., 1976; Milton et al., 2009). frequently used proxy AGB NDVI (Tucker, 1979) correlates green AGB (Tucker & Sellers, 1986; Ferner et al., 2015). quickest method assess living green biomass (Onodi et al., 2017b) good measure track seasonal changes within green plant biomass (Gamon et al., 1995). Using portable multi-spectral radiometer, incoming reflected light intensity measured different wavebands AGB observation plot. weather conditions need recorded precisely possible date time crucial information. Uniform overcast without direct radiation preferred condition measurements (Bertora et al., 2012), although newer equipment able account changes light intensity. advise reading manual equipment carefully.NDVI sensor can hand-held mounted boom AGB observation plots. sensor needs placed higher canopy larger AGB observation plot capture entire biomass within plot. example, Onodi et al. (2017b) levelled NDVI sensor 1.8 m 0.25 m2 plot 2.8 m 1 m2 plot. use boom reduces interference operator measurements. Multispectral radiometers usually composed paired sensors NIR810 R660 wavebands can measured simultaneously (INCREASE, 2014). Using spectrometer sensors incoming reflected light provides robust result thus dependent clear sky (INCREASE, 2014).NDVI calculated NDVI = (NIR0810 − R660) / (NIR810 + R660), NIR810 reflectance measured near-infrared (NIR) waveband (centred 810 nm) R660 reflectance measured red (R) waveband (660 nm). Note NDVI goes saturation high canopy density thus less effective vegetation becomes dense (leaf area index (LAI) 2) (Gamon et al., 1995).b) Visual cover estimation (Braun-Blanquet, 1932; Sykes et al., 1983; Peet et al., 1998). historically used assess plant community composition ecosystem (see protocol 4.8 Plant community composition). Visual cover estimation can also used estimate AGB climate-change experiments (Zhang & Welker, 1996; Tielbörger et al., 2014). Percentage cover typically estimated 25%, 30%, 35% etc. 20% cover, full numbers 2% 20%, one decimal digit cover 2%, .e. 1.5% 0.4% (Ónodi et al., 2017a). case multiple observers, training may needed facilitate consistency (Sykes et al., 1983). Based calibration plots destructive sampling, estimated cover can converted AGB. shown visual cover estimation can similar accuracy field spectroscopy point-intercept method estimating AGB (Ónodi et al., 2017a, 2017b).Measuring AGB forests (Gold standard)forests, AGB can estimated using allometric relationships, use simple measures diameter, sometimes variables, estimate complex variables, leaf biomass. commonly used model power form equation (= αBx + … +βZy), coefficients derived empirical measurements. Often equation form simplified = aDx, D tree diameter. allometric equations can vary considerably (Ketterings et al., 2001), gold standard uses site-specific allometric equations species. Several alternatives suggested improve precision generality. Chave et al. (2014) show least three tree parameters needed calculate robust, general allometric equations: 1) maximum tree height, 2) diameter breast height (DBH), 3) wood specific gravity. Monserud & Marshall (1999) also accounted height base crown competition indices, account differences tree shape variable stand density. Ketterings et al. (2001) use function tree height wood density parameterise across range sites, generalising equations site-specific equations longer necessary.drive allometric equations, following predictor variables often required:Maximum tree height measured trigonometric methods using laser equipment mechanically telescopic stick decimetre marks (Pérez-Harguindeguy et al., 2013).Maximum tree height measured trigonometric methods using laser equipment mechanically telescopic stick decimetre marks (Pérez-Harguindeguy et al., 2013).DBH defined diameter height 1.3 m. best measured using laser relascope, callipers, DBH-tape. case buttresses forked stems occurring 1.3 m, DBH measured just buttresses fork. (Hoover, 2008; Avery & Burkhart, 2015).DBH defined diameter height 1.3 m. best measured using laser relascope, callipers, DBH-tape. case buttresses forked stems occurring 1.3 m, DBH measured just buttresses fork. (Hoover, 2008; Avery & Burkhart, 2015).Dendrometers used measure changes stem size single radius, across diameter around circumference stem particular height. within-season measurements changes stem diameter radius, manual automatic methods available (Drew & Downes, 2009). Stainless steel band dendrometers, installed breast height, can used determine onset cessation diameter growth, well seasonal variations growth. measurements can made manually using digital callipers, also band dendrometers automatic recording. Point dendrometers can measure changes stem, branch, coarse root radii resolution less 1 µm. high resolution, diurnal swelling shrinking stem can seen (Zweifel & Häsler, 2001). stem radius changes consist actual radial growth shrinkage swelling inflow outflow water (cf. Zweifel et al., 2006).Wood specific gravity measured oven dry biomass divided fresh volume. Biomass measurement obtained taking wood core breast height using increment corer, aiming pith tree. Fresh volume calculated core cylinder length measured immediately sampling core removing bark diameter defined increment corer (Williamson & Wiemann, 2010; Pérez-Harguindeguy et al., 2013). Data can also taken databases TRY (Kattge et al., 2011), DRYAD (Zanne et al., 2009), BAAD (Falster et al., 2015).European database developed Zianis et al. (2005), Forrester et al. (2017) developed one North American tree species. Jenkins et al. (2003) provide allometric equations, Chave et al. (2014) provide generic model tropical forest trees. international platform GlobAllomeTree can consulted different tree allometric equations (see Henry et al., 2013 references therein). Allometric relationships derived subset trees. AGB observation plots often relate one tree smaller group surrounding trees. Trees marked exact coordinates needed. Guidelines selection trees can found Smart et al. (2017) Bertora et al. (2012).Allometric equations highly species specific thus accommodate species-specific individual responses climate manipulation. use published allometric relationships species may suitable development AGB time interest incremental change AGB given time rather actual measure AGB information interest. However, environmental conditions years different responses trees conditions change, desired information AGB may hidden “noise” introduced using non-specific allometric relationships (Coomes & Allen, 2007).AGB small forest stands individual trees interest, suggest building allometric relationships nearby trees species interest (see Bertora et al., 2012 guidelines). building allometric relationships requires either sampling branches felling trees (Monserud & Marshall, 1999), actual measurement weight, DBH, wood density. sampling possible, protocol involving tree coring seasonal litter sampling introduced Smart et al. (2017, supplementary material) preferred use general allometric relationships found literature.Handling storage AGB (Gold standard)Plant material stored cool place oven immediately available metabolic processes can continue. plant material dried maximum 70 °C 72 h constant weight. Dried plant material shall stored desiccator cooling prevent dried material taking air humidity. Dried cooled plant material weighed nearest 0.01 grams. AGB expressed weight dry matter per unit area (g AGB m-2). clear rule, optimal temperature drying biomass . Drying temperatures range 50 - 80 °C (NutNet protocol; Milner & Elfyn Hughes, 1970; Pérez-Harguindeguy et al., 2013). Dependent plant material (fleshyness, thickness), time plant material needs dry constant weight varies. high temperatures can change components plant (e.g. damage secondary compounds, carbon compounds), affect biomass. Contrary, biomass dried low temperature (50 - 60 °C), metabolic processes may continue drying process can trigger stress reaction plant. cases affect biomass plant.Dried AGB can either stored paper bags, stored frozen plastic bags. latter convenient samples sorted different fractions. possible, dried material measured carbon nutrient content.startChave et al. (2014), Damgaard (2014), Fahey & Knapp (2007)","code":""},{"path":"carbon-and-nutrient-cycling.html","id":"special-cases-emerging-issues-and-challenges","chapter":"2 Carbon and nutrient cycling","heading":"2.1.1.2 Special cases, emerging issues, and challenges","text":") Special case: AGB sampling grazed systemsTo measure AGB grazed systems, gold standard “moveable exclosure” () method (McNaughton et al., 1996; Knapp et al., 2012). implies paired plot design, grazed study plots combined adjacent plots. paired plots moved one several times per year. movement frequency repeated sampling plant biomass reflect intensity herbivory plant re-growth rates (McNaughton et al., 1996); semi-arid environments, monthly time intervals growing season used (Knapp et al., 2012). Prior randomly moving paired plots new location within treatment area, AGB harvested plots (smaller area within ) adjacent grazed plot. special case, ANPP can calculated AGB harvested plots (see ) AGB grazed plots used estimate grazing offtake (Linstädter & Ruppert, 2015).bronze standard measuring AGB grazed conditions “clipping method”.

Sequential soil coring can used studying biomass roots distributed depth changes time, requires many destructive samplings, method laborious. Sample processing see Soil coring .-growth cores. Net root productivity can estimated -growth cores (Ostonen et al., 2005; Brunner et al., 2013; Arndal et al., 2018). -growth cores soil pits mesh bag net filled root free soil, ideally native site. Thus, prior installation, soil core taken roots removed soil. mesh bag diameter slightly larger soil corer placed soil pit root free soil filled back pit. soil can divided depths filled back order separated small pieces mesh bag material. Alternatively, soil pit can lined stiff mesh material “garden mesh/netting”. commonly used mesh size 2 mm. -growth core incubated soil depths soil sampled (e.g. 0–30 cm) depending main rooting depth.

However, tropics temperate ecosystems, pioneer plant (tree) species, shorter time periods appropriate. first harvest, root-free soil may replaced pit subsequent harvest can take place.

Sample processing see Soil coring .Root -growth mesh (called also nets, sheets, screens)Measurements root production sequential soil coring, root imaging (see ), -growth cores time labour intensive, high degree uncertainty, can induce changes chemical physical properties soil. root -growth mesh method proposed alternative technique overcome problems (Fahey & Hughes, 1994; Jentschke et al., 2001; Godbold et al., 2003). Using technique, root production estimated placing mesh (example 7–10 cm x 20–40 cm, 1–2 mm mesh size) vertically soil specific period time measuring number weight roots grow mesh (Hirano et al., 2009). procedure much easier methods, requires simple equipment, causes minimal soil disturbance (Godbold et al., 2003). method discussed Ohashi et al. (2016) Montagnoli et al. (2014).root nets (preferably 15–30 per sampling time) extracted soil 10 x 10 cm soil blocks (Lukac & Godbold, 2010) annually end every vegetation period. Extracted nets washed free soil lab, fine roots grown mesh counted cut 1 cm sides net create ‘virtual’ 2 cm thick core. Roots removed net different plant species can separated visually distinguishable, although living roots can estimated method.Several methods exist calculate fine-root production change fine-root biomass necromass data. “Maximum-Minimum” method calculates annual fine-root production subtracting lowest biomass highest biomass value irrespective biomass values recorded full year (McClaugherty et al., 1982). “Decision Matrix” method calculates annual fine-root production balancing living dead root biomass compartments summing calculated productions pair consecutive sampling dates throughout full year (Fairley & Alexander, 1985).Non-destructive methodsRoot imaging: Mini-rhizotrons, flatbed scanners, smartphone solutions. common technique based direct observations root growth dynamics situ mini-rhizotron method (see Picture 2.5), although also root windows, rhizotrons, flatbed scanner smartphone imaging methods use. methods enable following root growth dynamics phenology birth death finest, ephemeral, distal roots (reviewed Hendrick & Pregitzer, 1996; Johnson et al., 2001; Rewald & Ephrath, 2013; Mohamed et al., 2017).\nFigure 2.5: Installation mini-rhizotron.

Long sampling intervals can underestimate root production, roots can grow die sampling events, , general, relatively shorter intervals used productive systems. studies use intervals 2–4 weeks: using intervals < 3 weeks underestimate root production five different ecosystems (Balogianni et al., 2016).Sample processing: method labour intensive. Currently, images roots analysed manually mapping roots, usually using specific software (WinRhizotron (Regent Inc), Rootfly (Clemson University, free software), RootSnap (CID BioScience, free software), etc).Mini-rhizotrons excellent tool measure timing root production mortality (root phenology), often used estimating root longevity turnover. However, best method estimate root biomass, offer two-dimensional view soil. Several conversion methods exist use mini-rhizotron data infer root biomass: see Metcalfe et al. (2007) comparison different methods.Turnover rateThe term turnover rate certain root category means rate root biomass replaced year. Fine-root turnover rate dependent fine-root biomass annual production fine roots, also various methods calculations (Brunner et al., 2013). mean lifespan can calculated dividing “pool” (biomass) “input” (annual production). turnover rate inverse lifespan, can calculated dividing “annual production” “root standing biomass” (Gill & Jackson, 2000), commonly means average root biomass, several studies using maximum root biomass instead. According Brunner et al. (2013), however, using maximum fine-root biomass calculate fine turnover rate, results 30% higher values root turnover. decrease lab intensity, combined method proposed – fine-root turnover rate calculated -growth cores/sheets multiplied fine-root biomass estimated soil cores (Ostonen et al., 2005; Löhmus & Ostonen, 2006).mini-rhizotrons, individual roots can observed birth death estimations root longevity. However, difficult ecosystems long-lived roots systems lot soil movement (e.g. freeze-thaw drying re-wetting soils). Similarly destructive methods, turnover rate can also calculated mini-rhizotrons using observed root growth total root length density.Radiocarbon (14C) content used estimate fine-root productivity fine-root turnover (Gaudinski et al., 2001) using fallout 14C signal nuclear weapons testing 1950s 1960s. method requires good knowledge sampling roots known age.startAddo-Danso et al. (2016), Mancuso (2012), Rewald & Ephrath (2013), Smit et al. (2014)2.1.2.2 Special cases, emerging issues, challenges15N assay.
