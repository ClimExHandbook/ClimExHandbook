We want to ensure that the ClimEx handbook will also be a useful resource for the community in the future. Comments and suggestions for updating the protocols are welcome and can be made <a href="https://github.com/ClimExHandbook/ClimExHandbook/issues">here</a>.

The comments and suggestions will be assessed by the authors of the ClimEx handbook periodically, and it might take some time before you hear back from us. All the changes and updates that are made to the protocols are track changed via our <a href="https://github.com/ClimExHandbook/ClimExHandbook">GitHub repository</a>.
