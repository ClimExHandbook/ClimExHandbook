<h2>Usage<img class="wp-image-77 size-medium alignright" src="http://climexhandbook.w.uib.no/files/2019/11/ClimEx-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></h2>
For each protocol, we provide a short overview of the equipment and running costs,Â  installation and maintenance effort, knowledge-needs, and the type of measurements conducted. Note that this overvie<span style="font-size: 0.9375rem">w is to a certain extent country-, habitat-, and project-dependent (i.e. costs differ between countries, knowledge-needs for species identification might differ between a rainforest and a temperate bog, etc.).</span>

We give a short summary of the ecological background and its relevance to terrestrial climate-change studies. We succinctly describe <em>What and how to measure</em>, providing sufficient detail to ensure reproducibility, and provide a reference list with more extensive literature on each method. We describe a <em>Gold standard</em>, that is the optimal measurement irrespective of economic, technical, and practical constraints, and (if applicable) a <em>Bronze standard,</em> that is the minimal requirement for data of adequate quality which can be advisable in specific situations.

In the section on <em>Special cases, emerging issues, and challenges, </em>we explain how the method can be adapted in specific cases and provide guidance on relevant challenges and opportunities<em>.</em>

We further provide an extensive list of key references on the underlying theories, assumptions, and applications of each method in the section on <em>Theory, significance, and large datasets</em>, as well as under <em>More on methods and existing protocols</em>. These references may be especially useful for students, early-career scientists, or research teams getting started in setting up new studies, and more generally for readers interested in exploring the wider literature related to a specific ecological response variable.
